1. Mirrorer

This is a program for performing fetch/push mirrors on many git repos to many
remotes.  I currently use it to

* push commits from my code site (code.ninjawedding.org) to github and
  gitorious, and
* fetch new commits from repositories on github, gitorious, etc. that I'm
  interested in.

2. Installation

You'll need a Ruby 1.9 implementation.  Ruby 1.9.3-p362 and Rubininus
2.0.0.rc1 are known to work.

  $ git clone
  $ cd (repo)
  $ bundle install

3. Running

Establish fetch or push mirror remotes in each repository you want to act as a
fetch or push mirror:

  repo1$ git remote add github --mirror=push git@github.com:foo/bar.git
  repo2$ git remote add gitorious --mirror=fetch git://gitorious.org/prj/repo.git

Then run mirror.rb:

  ruby mirror.rb /var/repo_root github gitorious some_other_remote ...

The contents of repo1 will be pushed to the github remote, and a fetch will be
done against gitorious for repo2.

Please note that fetches and pushes are currently unordered, so you shouldn't
yet use this program for e.g. integrating many repositories into one
repository, and then mirroring that integration repository to many places.
That'll be fixed soon.

4. License

This program is dedicated to the public domain.
