1. Mirrorer

This is a program for performing fetch/push mirrors on many git repos to many
remotes.  I currently use it to

* push commits from my code site (code.ninjawedding.org) to github and
  gitorious, and
* fetch new commits from repositories on github, gitorious, etc. that I'm
  interested in.

2. Installation

You'll need a Ruby 1.9 implementation.  Ruby 1.9.3-p362 and Rubininus
2.0.0.rc1 are known to work.

  $ git clone
  $ cd (repo)
  $ bundle install

3. Running

Establish fetch or push mirror remotes in each repository you want to act as a
fetch or push mirror:

  $ git remote add github --mirror=push git@github.com:foo/bar.git
  $ git remote add gitorious --mirror=fetch git://gitorious.org/prj/repo.git

Then run mirror.rb:

  ruby mirror.rb /var/repo_root github gitorious some_other_remote ...

4. License

This program is dedicated to the public domain.
